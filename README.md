1. **Install Dependencies**
    Next, they need to install the necessary dependencies. This can be done using the `npm install` command:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
2. **Build the App**
    They can create a production build of the app using the `npm run build` command:
    ```bash
    npm run build    
    ```

3. **Run locally**
   Command to run this locally:    
   ```
   npx webpack serve  

   ```

4. **Deploy the App**
    Finally, they can deploy the app. There are many services they can use to deploy the app, such as Netlify, Vercel, or AWS Amplify. These services provide a simple way to deploy static websites, and they work well with React apps. They can connect these services to your GitHub repository and they will automatically deploy the app whenever you push changes to your repository.

    For example, to deploy the app with Netlify:
    - Go to Netlify and sign up for a free account.
    - Click on "New site from Git", select GitHub and authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account.
    - Select your repository from the list.
    - In the build settings, enter `npm run build` as the build command and `build` as the publish directory.
    - Click on "Deploy site".

    The site will now be deployed, and any changes you push to your GitHub repository will automatically be deployed to the site.
